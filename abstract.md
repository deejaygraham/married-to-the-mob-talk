# Married to the Mob (Programming)

"All the brilliant people, working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer."

That may sound like a recipe for disaster but Mob Programming is a new way of working for development teams 
that encourages collaboration, promotes shared understanding and building, increases productivity and improves the quality 
of the software you deliver.

In this session you'll learn what makes Mobbing so effective and why it's better than working independently or in a pair.

We'll look at:

* Mechanics of Mobbing
* Organizing the environment
* Team heuristics
* Dealing with competing solutions
* Coding as a team
* Refactoring
* Tools
* "Real time" retrospectives
* Including subject matter experts, testers and analysts
* Woody Zuill - Evil, Genius or Evil Genius?

I'll share what I have learned over the last 18 months using Mob Programming at work, in training sessions and on open source 
project teams, how you can use it immediately to see benefit on your current project, how to get started and how to avoid 
getting stuck.

Woody - Comes up with these ideas

All the brilliant people working on the same problem, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer

Turn up the good echoing XP


Strong Style Pairing
For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone elses hands


Driver
At the keyboard
Trust the navigator
Computer of the SS enterprise

Navigator

Resolving conflict - experiment groups pairs

Strong accomplished teams, start to finish on a feature
Everyone has a part of the solution. Shared pain - something is taking too long - someone can build a tool.

Protocol if you aren't learning or contributing, you can go and do somethign else

Half baked ideas aren't wasted time - beware of a single dev in a room on their own.

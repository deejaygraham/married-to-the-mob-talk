  Green Refactor

  Simple Design
  Passes All Tests
  Clearn Expressive Consistent
  No Duplication
  Minimal

  Resolving conflict - experiment groups pairs

  Strong accomplished teams, start to finish on a feature
  Everyone has a part of the solution. Shared pain - something is taking too long - someone can build a tool.

  Protocol if you aren't learning or contributing, you can go and do somethign else

  Half baked ideas aren't wasted time - beware of a single dev in a room on their own.

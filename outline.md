# DDD North 2017 Married to the Mob (Programming)

46 slides max, 45 minutes plus questions. breaks for interest, stories, keep in mind Medina's Law

- Opener
  - Thank you for being here
  - Who I am
  - Questions

Not here to tell you that you have to do or this is the only way to do it
It is possible and teams are doing it and having success.

Getting started
  - 
  
  Common mistakes
  
  3 or more pepole get together to solve single problem.
  All over the world is being done.
  
  
  Pairing
  Evolution of XP
  
  Pairing - driver, navigator
  Driver is typing in, navigator looks for further - metaphor
  
  Terms not good
  Typist
  Rest of mob
  
  
  Typist
  - Listen to what mob is asking
  - Translate to code
  - Work with incomplete understanding at short intervals
  - Patience!
  - Don't premature challenge - endless discussions
  - Write the code, talk about the code, change - arguments fall away
  - Shared understanding.
  - Seeing code artefact
  - Short periods of time
    - Effective - typist duration is very small.
    
  Rest
    Discover what the next logical step is
    New mob nobody is in sync.
    Work collaboratively
    What is the next step and park everything else
    Talk at level of abstraction
      - Inexperienced
      - Synatax level
      - Extract method
      - Move to line, select lines, right click...
      - Communication is difficult
      - Challenge is hard to 
      
 Just for programmers?
  Testers
  Increase levels of understanding
    - Responsible to help understanding
    - If you don't understand - have courage to ask
    
  
  
  Woody father of mob. 
  Treat people with kindness consideration and respect
  
  Llewellyn (inception of mob) - useful way to do it even if not using mob
  
  Consideration
    - Listen and put your self in their place.
    - Understand where they are coming from
    
      
      
   Visible - good for discussion and insights
   Whiteboard - identify important things to park on whiteboard
   
   
   Can be very tiring but also the most productive, very enjoyable
   
   
   Doesn't work
    One person is an expert - don't give them a keyboard - not allowed to have the keyboards
    Get understanding from them
    
    Truck number
    
    Help everyone else get up to speed
    
    Nobody knows what's going on
    Legacy, person gone
    
    Timebox refactoring to improve code. At the end of the 20 mins. Talk about, throw away changes 
    
    New technology
      No body knows, needs research Timebox separation  - everyone has a different learning style
      What do we need to know to solve
        - Share what we have learned. 
        - Put puzzle parts together.
        
        
        
 Cost effective?
  Sage accountancy software
  Cost x 4
  Single person's job
  Is it cost effective
  Productivity and effectiveness
   Can you not just type faster
   
Deve productivity
  Knowledge work
  Lines of code?
  Number of hours?
  BUSYNESS
  Time to market
  Financial Return - systems thinking
    Dev
    Sales
    Marketing
    Really hard to measure 
  
What impacts developer productivity? Ask audience
  Meetings?
  Phone calls
  Project Managers?
  Interruptions?
  Slow decision makers
  Not available
  Solving the wrong problem
  Too many hours
  Code quality goes down
  Bugs
  Productivity of everyone - devs and testers
  Incomplete understanding - see defects
  Cruft - quality of code. Falco - on our own we get best and worst of us - graph
  - retro fit practices to compensate - code review
  Mob - Filters worst and get best all the time, 
  Technical Debt
  Investigating potential defects (not really a defect)
  
  Mutlitasking
    switch 15 minutes+ cost
    Multiple switches - lose hours per day
    Context switches are expensive
    Mob solves 
    
    Reduce WIP
  
  
  Grunt work
    
    
    
    Solo is faster
    Major cost in production is defects and maintenance
    Time spent overall is less due to improved quality
    
    Very expensive pair programming
    
    
    Ideal team size is 4 ish for complex problems
    2s is level of cleverest person
    3-5 can solve more complex problems than the clevest 
    American Psychological society study
    
    
    Pair programming
      Strong personalities vim or emacs
      Anti-pattern - heated and confrontational
      - Introverts
      - Person typing
      
      Increased flow.
      Work stops, meeting, come back, type
      Work flows because it's averaged.
      Work on the most important thing
        park other things
        
      
      Group majority
      Go where the majority wants to go
      
      
      Waiting for information
      If you are waiting there is someone missing from the mob
      
    
    
      Physical setup to get it right
      
      lareg screens
      Open space to work
      Keyboard
      Hunter pix 12 teams
      
  Timer
    - Rotate keyboard

  Mob
  One navigator, many drivers
  Navigator dumb typist
  Drivers are

  Woody - Comes up with these ideas

  All the brilliant people working on the same problem, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer

  Turn up the good echoing XP


  Strong Style Pairing
  For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone elses hands

- Roles
  - Driver
    - At the keyboard
    - Trust the navigator
    - Make it so
    
  - Navigator
    - Verbal instructions
    - No keyboard
    - Talk at highest level of abstraction
      - intent
      - 
      - syntax
  - Mobber

  - Researcher
  
  - Sponsor
  
  - Learner ?
  
  
- Timing is everything
  - Switch every 5 minutes, 10 minutes
  - How often
  - How relaxed
  - Strict timer
  
  


"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, when you have only one idea"
- Emile-Auguste Chartier
 Beware of a single programmer, alone in a room
 
The most dangerous

Pragmatic Programmers

  Timer - switch to new keyboard every 5 minutes, 10 minutes

  keyboard is not hard work, navigators have harder work.

  No standup!
  resilience
  Truck number
  Getting things done and delivered.

  Worktime flexibility
  Looks weird
  Management buyin

  reflection !!! -> Learning

  Loudest voice
  Navigator
  Mob the RPG

  Mob Timer - Start Mobbing Driver, Mobber, Mobber, Navigator

  Roles

  Driver


  Navigator


  Mobber

  Not solo programming with an audience
  Its fun

  TDD is easier
  Red
  Green Refactor

  Simple Design
  Passes All Tests
  Clearn Expressive Consistent
  No Duplication
  Minimal

  Resolving conflict - experiment groups pairs

  Strong accomplished teams, start to finish on a feature
  Everyone has a part of the solution. Shared pain - something is taking too long - someone can build a tool.

  Protocol if you aren't learning or contributing, you can go and do somethign else

  Half baked ideas aren't wasted time - beware of a single dev in a room on their own.

Role

Driver

    Ask a clarifying question about what to type
    Type something you disagree with
    Use a new keyboard shortcut
    Learn something new about tooling
    Ignore a direct instruction from someone who isn't the Navigator

Navigator

    Ask for ideas
    Filter the mob's ideas then tell the Driver exactly what to type
    Tell the Driver only your high-level intent and have them implement the details
    Create a failing test. Make it pass. Refactor.

Mobber

    Yield to the less privileged voice
    Contribute an idea
    Ask questions till you understand
    Listen on the edge of your seat

Researcher

    Find and share relevant information from documentation
    Find and share relevant information from a blog
    Find and share relevant information from a coding forum

Sponsor

    Amplify the unheard voice
    Pick the mobber with the least privilege (gender/race/class/seniority/etc) and support their contributions
    Celebrate moments of excellence

Rear Admiral

    Quietly speak into the navigators ear
    Give the smallest cue necessary to move the Navigator forward through the problem
    Navigate the navigator at the highest level of abstraction they can successfully implement

Automationist

    Point out a repeated task in a tool
    Point out a repeated aspect of team process
    Point out possible boiler plate code
    Propose an automation for a repeated task

    Pairing some styles
      Typing person has idea. and is typing into the keyboard, not description
      Other person is reading back from screen
      Not good tranlation
      
      Flow being in the zone, Mihaly Chiczhemis
      
      At keyboard for a few minutes at a time
      QUality of thought is more important than quality of typing.

"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, when you have only one idea"
- Emile-Auguste Chartier
 Beware of a single programmer, alone in a room
 
The most dangerous

Pragmatic Programmers

  Timer - switch to new keyboard every 5 minutes, 10 minutes

  keyboard is not hard work, navigators have harder work.

  No standup!
  resilience
  Truck number
  Getting things done and delivered.

  Worktime flexibility
  Looks weird
  Management buyin

  reflection !!! -> Learning

  Loudest voice
  Navigator
  Mob the RPG

  Mob Timer - Start Mobbing Driver, Mobber, Mobber, Navigator

  TDD is easier
  Red
  Green Refactor

  Simple Design
  Passes All Tests
  Clearn Expressive Consistent
  No Duplication
  Minimal

  Resolving conflict - experiment groups pairs

  Strong accomplished teams, start to finish on a feature
  Everyone has a part of the solution. Shared pain - something is taking too long - someone can build a tool.

  Protocol if you aren't learning or contributing, you can go and do somethign else

  Half baked ideas aren't wasted time - beware of a single dev in a room on their own.

  - Questions at any time
  
- 3 Important Questions
  - What is mob programming?
  - How do I do it?
  - Is Woody Zuill an Evil Genius? 
  - Strong Style as big take away

- Agile
  - Audience poll
  
- XP & Pairing
  - Two devs sitting at a keyboard, swapping between them
  - Driver has an idea of how to proceed and types code
  - Navigator is thinking about the road ahead
  - Swap when person stalls and other person has an idea
  - One person typing their ideas, one person nodding along
  - Not talking often
  - How many people consider themselves XP?
  - How many do some level of pairing?
  - What do you find difficult about it?
  - Who has tried it and didn't like it?
  - Why didn't you like it?
  
  
- Anti-Patterns
  - Dev typing (not explaining verbally)
  - Other Dev reading what is typed and making sense of it.
  - Strong personalities
  - Often see one person typing and another is the nodding dog.
  - Dreyfuss Model of Skill Acquisition
  - Pairing with Beginners
  - Pairing Experts
  - Pairing Expert and Senior

  
- What is Mob Programming - XP++
  - That's some nice code you got there
  - It would be a pity if anything happened to it
  - Evolution of XP 
    - Makes sense
    - I have had a similar kind of thing
  - Woody Quote
  - Where > 3 people collaborate on a single computer to solve a problem or series of problems
  - There are rules and guidelines
  
  
- Rules
  - Kindness 
  - Consideration
  - Respect

- Guidelines
  - Everyone has a role
  - Swap roles every so often

- Roles

  - I don't like these two descriptors but...
  - Driver or Typist
    - Listen to what mob is asking
    - Translate that to code
    - Work with incomplete understanding at short intervals
    - Patience!
    - Don't premature challenge - leads endless discussions
    - Write the code, talk about the code, change - arguments fall away
  
  - Rest of Mob
    - Discover what the next logical step is
    - Work collaboratively
    - What is the next step and park everything else
    - Talk at right level of abstraction for typist
      - Inexperienced
      - Synatax level
      - Extract method
      - Move to line, select lines, right click...
      - Communication is difficult
      - Challenge is hard to 
      
         - Responsible to help understanding
    - If you don't understand - have courage to ask
 
      
  - Optional Navigator

- Problems & Amplification
  - Amplified learning
  - 
 - Shared understanding.
    - Seeing code artefact
    - Short periods of time
    - Effective - typist duration is very small.
    New mob nobody is in sync.
 - Some teams hate typing - switching is easy
 - Some with high trust - it's a finish the thought kind of thing
 - Others need a physical timer to force a change
   
   
- Environment
  - Shyness
  - Everyone must be able to see the screen
  - Big screens
  - Wireless keyboard and mouse
  - Local laptop
  
- Other Approaches

  - Mob testing


- Teams

  - LateRooms.com
  - Hunter Industries
  - Alaska Airlines
  - Unruly Media
  - Industrial Logic
  - Menlo Innovations
  
  
- Before I begin
  - Not here to tell you that you have to do or this is the only way to do it
  - But - It is possible and teams all over the world are doing it and having success.
  - Alaska Airlines, Hunter Technologies, Unruly media, Late rooms
  - Woody has hundreds of cases - travels the world advising teams
  
  
  
  
- Research 
  - Psychology study - teams up to 3 people - solve ordinary problems defined by smartest person.

- Takeaways
  - Pairing
  - Do strong style pairing !!!
  - Adhoc Mob when you can - hard to do culture change to do full mobbing
  - Mob ad-hoc seems to be good second best
  
- Closer
  - Thank you for being here
  - Woody is back in UK in July 2018 
  - Questions
  - Feedback forms
  
  
- Need To Work on:
  - Story around (Need to work in my unimaginative steps)
  - How to fit strong style pairing
  - Isn't it just massively inefficient Pair programming?
  - How is it different from Swarming?

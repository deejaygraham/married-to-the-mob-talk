  Mob
  One navigator, many drivers
  Navigator dumb typist
  Drivers are

  Woody - Comes up with these ideas

  All the brilliant people working on the same problem, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer

  Turn up the good echoing XP


  Strong Style Pairing
  For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone elses hands

- Roles
  - Driver
    - At the keyboard
    - Trust the navigator
    - Make it so
    
  - Navigator
    - Verbal instructions
    - No keyboard
    - Talk at highest level of abstraction
      - intent
      - 
      - syntax
  - Mobber

  - Researcher
  
  - Sponsor
  
  - Learner ?
  
  
- Timing is everything
  - Switch every 5 minutes, 10 minutes
  - How often
  - How relaxed
  - Strict timer
  
  


"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, when you have only one idea"
- Emile-Auguste Chartier
 Beware of a single programmer, alone in a room
 
The most dangerous

Pragmatic Programmers

  Timer - switch to new keyboard every 5 minutes, 10 minutes

  keyboard is not hard work, navigators have harder work.

  No standup!
  resilience
  Truck number
  Getting things done and delivered.

  Worktime flexibility
  Looks weird
  Management buyin

  reflection !!! -> Learning

  Loudest voice
  Navigator
  Mob the RPG

  Mob Timer - Start Mobbing Driver, Mobber, Mobber, Navigator

  Roles

  Driver


  Navigator


  Mobber

  Not solo programming with an audience
  Its fun

  TDD is easier
  Red
  Green Refactor

  Simple Design
  Passes All Tests
  Clearn Expressive Consistent
  No Duplication
  Minimal

  Resolving conflict - experiment groups pairs

  Strong accomplished teams, start to finish on a feature
  Everyone has a part of the solution. Shared pain - something is taking too long - someone can build a tool.

  Protocol if you aren't learning or contributing, you can go and do somethign else

  Half baked ideas aren't wasted time - beware of a single dev in a room on their own.

Role

Driver

    Ask a clarifying question about what to type
    Type something you disagree with
    Use a new keyboard shortcut
    Learn something new about tooling
    Ignore a direct instruction from someone who isn't the Navigator

Navigator

    Ask for ideas
    Filter the mob's ideas then tell the Driver exactly what to type
    Tell the Driver only your high-level intent and have them implement the details
    Create a failing test. Make it pass. Refactor.

Mobber

    Yield to the less privileged voice
    Contribute an idea
    Ask questions till you understand
    Listen on the edge of your seat

Researcher

    Find and share relevant information from documentation
    Find and share relevant information from a blog
    Find and share relevant information from a coding forum

Sponsor

    Amplify the unheard voice
    Pick the mobber with the least privilege (gender/race/class/seniority/etc) and support their contributions
    Celebrate moments of excellence

Rear Admiral

    Quietly speak into the navigators ear
    Give the smallest cue necessary to move the Navigator forward through the problem
    Navigate the navigator at the highest level of abstraction they can successfully implement

Automationist

    Point out a repeated task in a tool
    Point out a repeated aspect of team process
    Point out possible boiler plate code
    Propose an automation for a repeated task

Nose

    Point out a long line of code
    Point out a complex conditional
    Point out duplication
    Point out an unnamed variable or method
    Propose an action for deodorizing the code

Working together, not working individually and getting together to scrum

- Woody

  - At hunter
    - Turn up the good on working together
    - What we noticed - good and wanted to try more of working together

- Rotate Roles

  - Analysts
  - Testers
  - Devs
  - Product Experts - why are we making it - part of the team at least partially
  
  - Whole workflow, people knwo part, overlapping knowledge but not complete- handoffs
  
  
  - Green field projects
  
  
- Driver
  - One person typing
  - Translates thoughts team is having into code that a computer can use
  - Programming is code and learning and thinking about what we are doing
  - Whole team thinking, learning and translating through
  
  
- Exhausting in meetings
  - Mobs are not meetings
  - Pay attention but not intent
  - Super laser focus wears you out
  
  - Get up, go work on something else, where can you contribute in the right way at the right time.
  - Respond to current situation
  
  - Efficient?
    - Effectiveness !!!
    - Not typing pool
    - What destroys productivity
    - Blocking Questions - queue
    - Waiting for answers
      - Sitting together
      - Better to clarify rather than email or waiting for a meeting

  Jackson and Mei
  
  
  Simple principles
    - Strong pairing
    - Articulate idea before part of code
    
    Pairing some styles
      Typing person has idea. and is typing into the keyboard, not description
      Other person is reading back from screen
      Not good tranlation
      
      Flow being in the zone, Mihaly Chiczhemis
      
      At keyboard for a few minutes at a time
      QUality of thought is more important than quality of typing.
      
      SQL, C#, Javascript, Html
      Shared cognitive burden

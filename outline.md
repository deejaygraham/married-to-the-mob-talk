46 slides max, 45 minutes plus questions. breaks for interest, stories, keep in mind Medina's Law

- Opener
  - Thank you for being here
  - Who I am
  - Questions at any time
  
- 3 Important Questions
  - What is mob programming?
  - How do I do it?
  - Is Woody Zuill an Evil Genius? 
  - Strong Style as big take away

- Agile
  - Audience poll
  
- XP & Pairing
  - Two devs sitting at a keyboard, swapping between them
  - Driver has an idea of how to proceed and types code
  - Navigator is thinking about the road ahead
  - Swap when person stalls and other person has an idea
  - One person typing their ideas, one person nodding along
  - Not talking often
  - How many people consider themselves XP?
  - How many do some level of pairing?
  - What do you find difficult about it?
  - Who has tried it and didn't like it?
  - Why didn't you like it?
  
  
- Anti-Patterns
  - Dev typing (not explaining verbally)
  - Other Dev reading what is typed and making sense of it.
  - Strong personalities
  - Often see one person typing and another is the nodding dog.
  - Dreyfuss Model of Skill Acquisition
  - Pairing with Beginners
  - Pairing Experts
  - Pairing Expert and Senior

  
- What is Mob Programming - XP++
  - That's some nice code you got there
  - It would be a pity if anything happened to it
  - Evolution of XP 
    - Makes sense
    - I have had a similar kind of thing
  - Woody Quote
  - Where > 3 people collaborate on a single computer to solve a problem or series of problems
  - There are rules and guidelines
  
  
- Rules
  - Kindness 
  - Consideration
  - Respect

- Guidelines
  - Everyone has a role
  - Swap roles every so often

- Roles

  - I don't like these two descriptors but...
  - Driver or Typist
    - Listen to what mob is asking
    - Translate that to code
    - Work with incomplete understanding at short intervals
    - Patience!
    - Don't premature challenge - leads endless discussions
    - Write the code, talk about the code, change - arguments fall away
  
  - Rest of Mob
    - Discover what the next logical step is
    - Work collaboratively
    - What is the next step and park everything else
    - Talk at right level of abstraction for typist
      - Inexperienced
      - Synatax level
      - Extract method
      - Move to line, select lines, right click...
      - Communication is difficult
      - Challenge is hard to 
      
         - Responsible to help understanding
    - If you don't understand - have courage to ask
 
      
  - Optional Navigator

- Problems & Amplification
  - Amplified learning
  - 
 - Shared understanding.
    - Seeing code artefact
    - Short periods of time
    - Effective - typist duration is very small.
    New mob nobody is in sync.
 - Some teams hate typing - switching is easy
 - Some with high trust - it's a finish the thought kind of thing
 - Others need a physical timer to force a change
   
   
- Environment
  - Shyness
  - Everyone must be able to see the screen
  - Big screens
  - Wireless keyboard and mouse
  - Local laptop
  
- Other Approaches

  - Mob testing


- Teams

  - LateRooms.com
  - Hunter Industries
  - Alaska Airlines
  - Unruly Media
  - Industrial Logic
  - Menlo Innovations
  
  
- Before I begin
  - Not here to tell you that you have to do or this is the only way to do it
  - But - It is possible and teams all over the world are doing it and having success.
  - Alaska Airlines, Hunter Technologies, Unruly media, Late rooms
  - Woody has hundreds of cases - travels the world advising teams
  
  
  
  
- Research 

  Research backs it up
  A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology looked at the effects of group size on problem solving.
  Researchers compared the problem-solving performance of small groups to that of individuals working alone. 
  The results of the study indicate that groups of three solve problems better than even the best individuals working alone.
  What are the implications of these results? The findings may be useful in academics, where problem solving groups might serve as an effective learning tool. Groups and teams in science, health care, and business may also find these techniques useful as well.

- Takeaways
  - Pair
  - Do strong style pairing !!!
  - Mob when you can - hard to do culture change to do full mobbing
  - Mob ad-hoc seems to be good second best
  - Hopfully it will catch on

  
- Closer
  - Thank you for being here
  - Hope it was useful
  - Woody is back in UK in July 2018 
  - Questions
  - Feedback forms
  
  
- Need To Work on:
  - Story around (Need to work in my unimaginative steps)
  - How to fit strong style pairing
  - Isn't it just massively inefficient Pair programming?
  - How is it different from Swarming?

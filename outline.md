# Married to the Mob (Programming)

## DDD North October 2017

- Opener
  - Thank you for being here
  - Who I am
  - Questions at any time
  - Who is XP-er?
  - Who is Agile-er?
  - Who is mobbing?

- What is it?
  - Single Programmer
  - XP Pairing - Driver and Navigator - rotate? Problems - strong personalities, not talking
  - Swarming
  - Mobbing = XP++
  - Where > 3 people collaborate on a single computer to solve a problem or series of problems
  - There are rules and guidelines
  - Definition
  - Woody's Definition
  - Rachel quote
  - What it's not - chance for you to show off coding skills to an audience
  - Strong accomplished teams, start to finish on a feature
  - Everyone has a part of the solution. Shared pain - something is taking too long - someone can build a tool.

- Mechanics
  - Single set of input devices
  - Whole team can see screen
  - Each person has a role
  - Roles rotate in the team

- Roles
  - XP - Driver and Navigator metaphor, driver active, navigator passive
  - Mob turns that Inside out
  - Driver
  - Navigator(s)
  - Facilitator (if group too large or to get started)

- Rules
  - KCR
    - spending a lot of time together (woody quotes)
    - different approaches, knowledge experience
    - Fundamental attribution error
  - Kerth's Prime Directive (Respect)

  - Yes and... from improve. for ideas in coding and ... ?
  - Strong Style Pairing

- Driver or Typist
  - XP driver is doing hard work. In Mob he has the easy job
  - Listen to what mob is asking
  - Translate that to code
  - Work with incomplete understanding at short intervals
  - Patience!
  - Don't premature challenge - leads endless discussions
  - Write the code, talk about the code, change - arguments fall away
  - If you have the keyboard, you can't have the ideas.

- Rest of Mob
  - Discover what the next logical step is
  - Work collaboratively
  - What is the next step and park everything else
  - Talk at right level of abstraction for typist
    - Inexperienced
    - Syntax level
    - Extract method
    - Move to line, select lines, right click...
    - Communication is difficult
    - Challenge is hard to

       - Responsible to help understanding
  - If you don't understand - have courage to ask
  - Sit on your hands!
  - Ideal team size seems to be 5

- Mob Environment
  - Screen or Projector
  - Keyboard and mouse
  - Seating
  - Whiteboard, pen and paper for rabbit holes
  - Local laptop
  - Github, RDP or laptop plugged in.
  - Other computers are allowed - research, deployment, testing, email. Not for checkins

- Role Rotation
  - Tiredness Kills
  - Take break
  - Levels of trust
  - Hate typing - switching is easy
  - Physical intervention - timer, egg timer, pomodoro, or software timer.

- Working as a Team
  - Testers
  - Business Analysts
  - Experts - don't give them the keyboard.

- What to Expect
  - Scary talking and coding in front of people
  - Tiring
  - Loud
  - Shyness
  - Dev weaknesses
  - Lots of shouting out
  - Excitement
  - Disturbing other teams
  - Beware rabbit holes
  - Loss of individual contribution (may not work for Jira)
  - Solo is faster to ship but not in overall scheme of lifetime.
  - Major cost in production is defects and maintenance
  - Time spent overall is less due to improved quality

- Benefits
  - Constant Code review
  - Learning
  - Code Styles and Standards
  - Correctness
  - Readability
  - Dry, SOLID etc.
  - Super short feedback loop
  - Truck number
  - Help
  - Task completion
  - Reduced handoffs
  - Whole team ownership
  - No standup

- Amplification
  - Good and bad
  - Makes bad code or bad tests obvious
  - Makes slow code obvious
  - Manual processes.
  - TDD is easier
  - Spreads the load, meetings, illness, holidays
  - Spreads the load - someone is thinking scope, security, performance, deployment, design efficiency
  - Whole team ownership - it's our code.
  - Perform better in front of peers
  - everyone learns something
  - productivity can be slow to start - team forming
  - shared understanding improved
  - Continuous code review - readability (clean code ambiguous)
  - Reduces truck number
  - No standups - saved time
  - Team building
  - Productivity - no context switching
  - Half baked ideas can be shared and developed - not fully implemented or discarded.
  - More interesting
  - Fun
  - Talking !


  - My team noticed swarming and mobbing as first time acted and felt like a team

- Productivity Blockers

  - Reasons for frustration
  - Information silos
  - Too many meetings
  - Testing or reviewing too late
  - Inconsistent coding
  - accruing technical debt
  - context switching
  - Waiting for questions to be answered

- Good for
  - Green field
  - Onboarding new people
  - Difficult work
  - Problem solving

- Not good for
  - Short tasks
  - Dev Ops(pair)
  - JFDI

- Disagreements and Uncertainty
  - Try writing the code - timebox crazy ideas. Try it, discuss and always roll it back.
  - Discuss it
  - Timebox
  - Investigation spikes
  - Research
  - Optional no coercion- stay if you are learning or contributing otherwise find something else useful to do.

- Slow down
  - Concentrate on doing the right thing and doing the thing right.

- Inspecting and Adapting
  - Retrospectives - quick huddle
  - Each day
  - Each week
  - How are we doing, what's easy, what's hard?
  - Fix frustrations if you can.
  - Concentrate on what we can do better - turn up the good.

- Strong Style Pairing
  - Who has done Rubber duck debugging ?
  https://rubberduckdebugging.com/cyberduck/
  Rubber Duck debugging - why so easy - if you think through the problem easy to skip steps or assumptions - easy to fool yourself. If you talk it through, you actually force yourself to listen and are more skeptical about what you are saying. Verbalising fixes the bug in our brains where we short-circuit our thought processes.
  - Pragmatic Programmers
  - Driver has easy job, navigators have hard job of verbalising.
  - Llewellyn Falco formalized into mob programming while working with Woody.
  - Use this for immediate improvements.

- Mob Friendly Teams

- Resources

- Takeaways
  - Try it and expect to evolve
  - Culture change is hard
  - Flash Mob when you can
  - Do strong style pairing !!!
